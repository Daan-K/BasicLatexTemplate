# LatexTemplates
This repository contains my personal templates for LaTeX documents.

### basicLaTeX.tex
A very basic template which can be used for a wide range of purposes. It has the following features:
* Support for math
* Support for UTF-8 characters
* Regular quotation marks can be used
* Paragraphs are seperated by white lines, instead of indents

### paper.tex
A basic template for papers. It is based on basicLaTeX but also includes a bibliography.
